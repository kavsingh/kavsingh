Worked in a team developing the new Mazda Digital Platform, which allowed dealers to assemble their own promotional campaigns, and customers to build and preview customised vehicles.

- Built with React / Redux with SSR via EpiServer.
- My contributions include introducing shared state management patterns (Redux + Sagas) that worked with the SSR system's multiple app mount points.
