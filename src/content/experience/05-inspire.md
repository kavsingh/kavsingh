Built a number of online education modules which required a high degree of interactivity while offering responsive layouts which worked across devices.

- Worked closely with education and UI designers to ensure that designs were technically feasible without compromising on learning outcomes.
- Courses were often hosted on legacy LMS providers which sometimes meant projects had to build to multiple deploy targets.
